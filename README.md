# docket

**Pre-runs Claude Code's `/code-review` on every PR waiting for your review.**

<!-- Capture: run `docket` with a few entries in the queue (mixed verdicts, one
     highlighted so the panel shows a headline), terminal ~120x35, no real PR
     titles you'd rather not publish. Save as docs/assets/queue.png. -->

docket watches GitHub for PRs where your review is requested and reviews each
one headlessly, in an isolated worktree of your local clone — so by the time
you sit down, a finished review session is waiting to be resumed. Reviews
never write anything to GitHub; the output is a queue on your machine, one
verdict per PR. The name is the metaphor: a docket is the list of cases
waiting on a judge, and every entry here is a case awaiting your judgment.

## Install

```sh
brew install mrgawrys/tap/docket
```

Or from source (needs [bun](https://bun.sh)):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mrgawrys/docket && cd docket && ./install.sh
```

You'll also need:

- macOS — scheduling uses launchd, notifications use osascript
- `gh`, authenticated
- the [`claude`](https://code.claude.com) CLI, logged in — in the account
  [`claude_config_dir`](docs/configuration.md#claude_config_dir) points at, if
  you set one
- a local clone of every repo you want reviewed
- the code-review plugin —
  `claude plugin install code-review@claude-plugins-official` — unless you
  set a custom [`review_prompt`](docs/configuration.md#review_prompt) that
  doesn't run `/code-review`
- [`receive_enabled`](docs/configuration.md#receive_enabled) needs nothing
  extra: the default receive task is plain instructions. A
  [`receive_prompt`](docs/configuration.md#receive_prompt) is where a skill
  invocation goes if you have a review-receiving skill you'd rather run —
  checked, with its
  [`extra_receive_allowed_tools`](docs/configuration.md#extra_receive_allowed_tools)
  rule, whenever the keys are set: `docket receive` and `R` run them whether
  or not `receive_enabled` is on

`docket doctor` checks all of this and prints a fix for anything missing.

## Quickstart

1. **`docket`** — with no config yet, or one still holding the starter
   placeholders, it offers to set one up: a few questions right there in the
   terminal, or a claude-guided session that does the discovery for you. The
   quick route asks which GitHub account (of the ones `gh` is logged in as),
   whose PRs to watch — your orgs, and your own login for personal repos —
   and where your clones live, scanning three levels down for repos it can
   map. It then asks which review task to run — the default `/code-review`,
   or a custom one written in your `$EDITOR`, with claude offering to work
   out the extra tools that task needs. It writes the config and ends on
   doctor's ✓/✗ list, then the command you asked for carries on. When it
   comes up short — `gh` lists no orgs, the scan finds nothing — it offers
   to hand the rest to claude instead.
   Declining the offer leaves you steps 2 and 3, the by-hand route (which is
   also what `docket doctor` leaves you, and what the poller gets when nobody
   is there to ask).
2. **Edit `~/.config/docket/config.json`.** Two keys are required:

   ```json
   {
     "orgs": ["your-github-org"],
     "repos": {
       "your-github-org/api": "/Users/you/dev/api"
     }
   }
   ```

   `orgs` is polled for PRs where your review is requested; `repos` maps each
   repo to its local clone. Everything else has a sensible default — see the
   [configuration reference](docs/configuration.md).
3. **`docket doctor`** — it checks the whole review chain (config, clones, gh
   auth, claude, plugin). Every line should be ✓.
4. **`docket poll --dry-run`** — read-only; lists what would be reviewed.
   **Everything listed gets reviewed (and billed) once the poller is on**, so
   seed a pre-existing backlog as done first:

   ```sh
   jq '."ORG/REPO#N" = {status: "done", note: "seeded"}' state.json > s && mv s state.json
   ```

   (state lives in `~/.local/state/docket/`).
5. **`docket on`** — loads the launchd job. Run it from your normal shell,
   with your version manager active: the job inherits that PATH, so polled
   reviews see the same toolchain you do. Re-run it after changing your PATH.
   `docket status` to confirm.

From here, reviews arrive on their own — you get a macOS notification as each
one finishes.

## Day to day

`docket` opens the queue. Each row carries the review's verdict at a glance —
how many issues it would flag, and the risk it graded the PR — and the panel
under the list shows the highlighted PR's headline finding. It is a triage
screen: `enter` is how a review actually gets read.

```
j/k ↑/↓  move          tab  my PRs         enter  claude    s  shell
d  diff                D  denials          w  watch live    r  retry
n  review a PR by hand x  dismiss          K  kill          p  poll
S  sync                ?  help             q  quit
```

`enter` resumes the Claude session where the review ran, with full context —
ask follow-ups, push back, dig into a finding. `s` and `d` open the PR's
worktree: a shell in it, or its diff in your diff tool (configurable via
[`openers`](docs/configuration.md#openers)). `x` dismisses an entry and
removes its worktree; `K` kills a running review before it burns more tokens.
`n` opens a one-line input: paste a PR URL or `ORG/REPO#N` (optionally
followed by a note) to review it by hand. A verb this machine cannot run is
greyed out with the reason shown, rather than failing after the keypress.

**`tab` switches to the mirror view: PRs you authored.** Each row shows the
newest reviewer verdict on your PR; with
[`receive_enabled`](docs/configuration.md#receive_enabled), actionable
feedback triggers a headless receive run in that PR's checkout — it addresses
the feedback with edits and local commits only, never a push — and `enter` resumes the
resulting session where you inspect and push yourself. `R` runs receive by
hand (it works even with the automatic path off), `s`/`d` open the PR
branch's checkout, and `n` here starts a receive run for a pasted PR.

The rest of the CLI:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `docket review ORG/REPO#N ["note"]` | force-review any PR (URLs work too); the note is handed to the reviewer as extra context |
| `docket receive ORG/REPO#N ["note"]` | act on the review feedback on your own PR, regardless of `receive_enabled`; refuses a dirty or diverged checkout |
| `docket watch [ORG/REPO#N]` | follow a running review live; without an argument, follow the poller log |
| `docket sync` | reconcile with GitHub now: merged/closed PRs are dismissed, PRs you already reviewed show your verdict |
| `docket dismiss ORG/REPO#N` | mark an entry done without reviewing it |
| `docket doctor` | check the whole setup and print fixes |
| `docket prompt` | set the review task, and derive the tools it needs |
| `docket on` / `off` / `status` | manage the launchd poller |
| `docket log [N]` | tail the poller log |

## Denied permissions

Reviews run headless on a read-only tool allowlist, so a call outside it is
denied and the run carries on without whatever it asked for. Those denials are
read back off the run log when the review ends — for failed runs as much as
finished ones — and kept with the entry.

A `⊘ 5` chip on a row is how many calls that run had denied, and the panel
under the queue summarises them: the three biggest groups, and how many more
there are.

A run that failed left no session for `enter` to resume, so on that row `enter`
hands the denials to Claude instead — the panel says which it will do. `D` opens
the denials view whenever you'd rather read them first: one row per allowlist
entry that would have covered them, how many calls each covers, and up to three
of the commands turned away.

```
─ denials: acme/docket#6 ──────────────────── 5 rules, 6 blocked calls ─
 Bash(rg:*)             ×2
     rg -n 'TODO' src/
 Bash(gh pr comment:*)  ×1    ⚠ write-shaped
     gh pr comment 6 --body 'nit'
 Bash(gh pr diff:*)     ×1    ✓ already in your config

 ⏎  hand all of this to claude
 a  add the 1 safe rule to your config (4 skipped: 3 write-shaped, 1 already there)
 esc back to the queue · j/k scroll
```

`a` adds every safe rule at once to
[`extra_allowed_tools`](docs/configuration.md#extra_allowed_tools), so the next
review has them. Two kinds of group are always left out, and the line says how
many of each:

- **write-shaped** ones — `git push`, most `gh` verbs, `rm`, an interpreter or
  command runner like `sh`, `python` or `npx`. Allowing them wholesale gives up
  the guarantee that an unattended review changes nothing, so they stay a
  deliberate edit.
- ones **already in your config**: the call was denied anyway — a `*` in the
  middle of a pattern, a prefix the call never matched — so adding the same
  rule again fixes nothing.

Once a rule has landed the block says so and offers `r`, which re-runs that
review — the one the view was opened on, whatever the queue cursor has moved to
since.

`⏎` hands the whole set to an interactive claude session for what the
mechanical add can't settle. It starts in the repo's local clone (so the key
needs one) and carries the groups, your config path, the effective allowlist
and the run log. The standing order is research only: propose options, change
nothing. The session runs in claude's default permission mode, so anything it
does want to change prompts you, not docket.

## Configuration

Everything lives in `~/.config/docket/config.json`. Beyond `orgs` and
`repos`, the keys you're most likely to want:

- `review_prompt` — swap the default `/code-review` run for any review task
  you can phrase as a prompt; `docket prompt` sets it for you, together with
  the `extra_allowed_tools` the task needs
- `receive_enabled` — act on reviews *you* receive: pre-address the feedback
  on your own PRs when it lands (edits and local commits in the PR's
  checkout; never a push, never a GitHub write); `receive_prompt` swaps the
  task, e.g. for one invoking your own review-receiving skill
- `openers` — which shell and diff tool the queue's `s` and `d` keys launch
- `gh_account` — pin polling to one `gh` account, so `gh auth switch` can't
  silently blind the poller
- `ignored_teams` — skip PRs that only reach you through a team you're not
  really reviewing for
- `claude_env` / `claude_config_dir` — control the environment every claude
  invocation runs with

The full reference, with semantics and defaults for every key, is in
[docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

## How it works

Each poll asks GitHub for PRs awaiting your review and hands every new one to
its own detached runner, which runs `claude -p` headlessly in an isolated git
worktree with a locked-down, read-only tool allowlist. Runners survive the
poll process — Ctrl+C never cancels an in-flight review — and a finished
review becomes a row in the queue, its Claude session kept for you to resume.
The clone's working copy is never touched, and nothing is ever posted to
GitHub. Details, including the entry lifecycle and where state lives, are in
[docs/how-it-works.md](docs/how-it-works.md).

## Development

- `bun test` — run the test suite (fully mocked: no network, no tokens)
- `bun run dev` — run the CLI from source, e.g. `bun run dev status`
- `bun run demo <scenario>` — launch the TUI over seeded mock data (`--list` shows the scenarios)
- `bun run frames <scenario>` — print headless TUI frames (`all` sweeps every scenario)
- `bun run build` — compile the `docket` binary into `dist/`
- `bun run format` — format with Biome (`format:check` is enforced in CI)

Releases are pushed tags; see [packaging/README.md](packaging/README.md).
