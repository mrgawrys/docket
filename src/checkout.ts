// when it qualifies; one that does not — dirty, diverged, or checked out
// nowhere — gets a detached copy of docket's own at the PR head.
//
// visitCheckout is the *visit* policy: a human is about to walk in, so their
// work wins however it looks. It never inspects, mutates or bypasses their
// checkout, and creates one only when nothing local holds the branch — which
// is also why it needs no PR head sha, and so no network.
